My Hope Is That Everyone will use These Folders to organize files.

To Move Files. Right click the file. Click on Cut. Now Paste to where you want to move the file to.
This moves the file.

Please. Do this. And I will be happy
Thank you.

This shouldnt really break anything, if it does somehow then just delete the duplicate
firstinspires.ftc.teamcode folder the folder this Hope.txt file is in, and everything will go back to normal
